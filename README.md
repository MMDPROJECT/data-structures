# Common algorithms and data structures

## Why did I made this repository in the first place?

As a part my data structures course in university, I learned some basic algorithms and data structures, and in order to have a better knowledge and understanding of these ideas, I decided to go beyond textbooks and try to implement them by my self, and in some cases examen their performance (checkout notebook file in sortings directory). So I created this github repository to do it and put it online. I will try to continue to add more algorithms and structures and in general, more codes that I learn along the way of education.

## Where did these codes come from?

I studied 4th edition of CLRS textbook for my data structures course in university, so most of the codes and ideas come directly from pseudocodes of this textbooks, however I should admit that in some cases, I just copied GeeksForGeeks code and studied how it works :)

## Please, feel free to contribute :)

If you found any bugs in the already-existing codes, or you want to add a algorithm or pretty much any other code of yours which you find relevant to the subject of this repository, please feel free to contact me, or fork this project and make your changes and send a pull request; I will be happy to hear your ideas.
